    I believe a roaster is to a coffee farmer, what a publisher is to a writer.
    We are the last link in the chain of a journey of a coffee's story.
    The magic of any coffee is written on the farm; a unique tale crafted from
    variety, geography, history, know-how.
    As roasters, our jobs are to curate these stories and present them as honestly
    as possible (and in a nice wrapper), to our audience.
